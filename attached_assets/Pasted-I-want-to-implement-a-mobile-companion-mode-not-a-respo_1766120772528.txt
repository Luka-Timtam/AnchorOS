I want to implement a mobile companion mode, not a responsive version of the desktop app.

Before building anything new, remove or disable any existing mobile-specific or responsive code that was added during previous attempts to make the full app mobile compatible. This includes:

Mobile CSS overrides

Hover disabling hacks

Responsive layout changes

Mobile nav experiments
The goal is to reset mobile behaviour back to a clean baseline before introducing the companion mode.

Core principle

Desktop behaviour, layout, styling, and interactions must remain completely unchanged

Mobile is a separate, stripped-down experience, not a resized desktop

Treat mobile as its own interface with its own navigation and layout

When to activate mobile companion mode

On mobile screen sizes, load the mobile companion interface instead of the desktop UI

Do not attempt to adapt or reflow desktop components for mobile

Mobile companion goals

The mobile companion should be designed for quick, practical use while out and about, not deep configuration.

It should prioritise speed, clarity, and tap-friendly interactions.

Features that MUST be available in mobile companion mode

1. Leads & Clients

View a simplified list of leads and clients

Open a lead/client to see:

name

status

next action

notes (basic)

Ability to:

add a new lead

add a new client

log outreach on an existing lead/client

2. Outreach & Logging

Quickly log outreach actions

Minimal input, tap-first interactions

No hover or complex UI patterns

3. Tasks

View today’s tasks

Mark tasks as complete

Add simple tasks if needed

4. Calendar

Access the calendar widget

View upcoming items

Clean, mobile-sized presentation

5. Notes

View notes attached to leads or general notes

Add quick notes

6. Basic Stats

High-level stats only (counts, totals)

No graphs or complex analytics

7. Freelancing Page

Access the freelancing page

Log freelance income

View basic freelance totals

Navigation (important)

Use a completely new, mobile-only navigation

Navigation must be:

horizontal

touch-friendly

always accessible

Do not reuse the desktop side navigation

No hover-based interactions

Navigation should clearly link to:

Home / Today

Leads

Tasks

Calendar

Freelancing

Notes

Explicit exclusions from mobile companion

Full dashboards

Graph-heavy analytics

Deep settings or configuration pages

Gamification configuration

Desktop-style tables

Final intent

The mobile companion does not need feature parity or visual parity with desktop.
It only needs to be:

stable

usable

fast

focused on logging and checking progress

Desktop is the primary workspace.
Mobile is a companion tool.
