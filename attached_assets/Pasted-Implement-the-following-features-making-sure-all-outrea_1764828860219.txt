Implement the following features, making sure all outreach templates and cold call scripts exist on their own dedicated page separate from the main app sections.

====================================
1. OUTREACH TEMPLATES PAGE (NEW PAGE)
====================================

Create a new Blueprint called "templates" or "outreach_templates" with route prefix "/outreach-templates".

This MUST be its own standalone page in the navigation:
- Add a navbar link labeled “Templates”.
- Clicking it opens the full outreach template manager page.

====================================
PAGE STRUCTURE
====================================

GET /outreach-templates  
This page should act as a full template management interface.

Sections to include (clearly separated on the page):

1) Email Templates  
2) DM Templates  
3) Call Scripts (cold call + objections)  
4) Create New Template button

For each template row:
- name
- category (email, dm, call)
- subcategory (e.g. cold_call_script, follow_up, objection_handling)
- preview of content
- buttons/icons:
  - View
  - Edit
  - Delete
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Toggle favourite

Add filters at the top:
- category filter
- subcategory filter
- text search (name or content)

====================================
TEMPLATE STORAGE
====================================

Create a table: outreach_templates

Fields:
- id (pk)
- name (string)
- category (email, dm, call)
- subcategory (string: cold_call_script, follow_up, objection_handling, etc.)
- content (text)
- is_favourite (boolean)
- created_at
- updated_at

All cold calling scripts MUST be stored in this table under:
- category = "call"
- appropriate subcategory values.

====================================
TEMPLATE DETAILS
====================================

GET /outreach-templates/<id>
- Show full template content
- Buttons for:
  - Edit
  - Copy to clipboard
  - Back

GET + POST /outreach-templates/new
GET + POST /outreach-templates/<id>/edit
POST /outreach-templates/<id>/delete

====================================
COPY BEHAVIOUR
====================================

Copy-to-clipboard should be implemented via a simple JS snippet on the frontend.

====================================
2. DAILY SUMMARY EMAIL (WEEKDAYS ONLY)
====================================

At ~9:30am Mon–Fri, send a daily summary email to CRM_EMAIL (env variable).

Include:

• Follow-ups due today  
• Overdue follow-ups  
• Tasks due today  
• Outreach yesterday vs daily outreach goal  
• Current streak, XP, level, consistency score  
• New leads created yesterday  
• MRR snapshot: hosting + SaaS + total  

====================================
3. WEEKLY SUMMARY (INCLUDED IN MONDAY EMAIL)
====================================

On Mondays, extend the daily email with a weekly summary:

• Outreach count last week vs weekly goal  
• Deals closed last week  
• Revenue last week  
• MRR change vs previous week  

No extra email — add this section inside the Monday message.

====================================
4. EMAIL SCHEDULING ENDPOINT
====================================

Create route: GET /internal/run-daily-summary

This endpoint should:

• Accept either login session OR a secret token for automated access  
• Check day of week:  
  - If Saturday or Sunday → send nothing  
  - If Monday → send daily + weekly summary  
  - Otherwise → send daily summary  

Return JSON describing whether email was sent.

This endpoint will be called daily at ~9:30am by an external scheduler.
