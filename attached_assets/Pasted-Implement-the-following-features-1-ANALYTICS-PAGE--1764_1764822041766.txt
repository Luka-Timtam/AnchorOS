Implement the following features:

====================================
1. ANALYTICS PAGE
====================================

Create a new Blueprint named "analytics" with route prefix "/analytics".
Templates go in templates/analytics/.

Main route: GET /analytics  
Should display:

• Filters:
  - Date range (start_date, end_date)
  - Lead niche (from leads table)
  - Lead source
  - Optional lead status

If no filters selected, default to last 90 days.

Compute and display the following charts using Chart.js:

1) Monthly project revenue (bar chart, last 12 months)
2) MRR growth (line chart, last 12 months)
   - hosting MRR, SaaS MRR, total MRR
3) Outreach volume per week (last 12 weeks)
4) Deals closed per week (last 12 weeks)
5) Lead pipeline (counts by status)
6) 3-month revenue forecast:
   forecast = current MRR + avg(last 3 months of project revenue)

Pass all chart data as JSON from Flask to the Jinja template.

====================================
2. FOLLOW-UP REMINDERS (Version 1)
====================================

On the dashboard AND analytics page:

• “Follow Up Today”
  - leads where next_action_date = today AND status not in ["closed_won","closed_lost"]

• “Overdue Follow Ups”
  - leads where next_action_date < today AND status not closed

Display clickable counters on the Dashboard:

- “Follow up today: X”
- “Overdue: Y”

Clicking opens the Leads page with appropriate filters applied.

Do NOT create tasks automatically.

====================================
3. DASHBOARD WIDGET SELECTION
====================================

Create a single-row table: user_settings

Fields:
- show_mrr_widget
- show_project_revenue_widget
- show_outreach_widget
- show_deals_widget
- show_consistency_score_widget
- show_forecast_widget
- show_followup_widget

Defaults = True.

Add a settings page at /analytics/settings:
- Checkboxes for each widget
- POST updates user_settings

On the Dashboard:
- Conditionally render widgets based on user_settings.
- Analytics page should show all graphs, with an indicator for which ones are enabled for Dashboard.

Auto-create default user_settings row if missing.
