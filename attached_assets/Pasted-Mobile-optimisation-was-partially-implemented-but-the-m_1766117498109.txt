Mobile optimisation was partially implemented but the mobile experience is currently broken and inconsistent. I need a focused cleanup pass to make the app usable and stable on mobile, without touching or altering the desktop experience in any way.

Global constraints

Desktop layout and behaviour must remain completely unchanged

Mobile fixes should only apply in mobile view

Mobile does not need to be perfect or pretty, but it must be usable

Prioritise usability, tap access, and layout stability over animations or effects

Issues to fix

Dashboard layout

Dashboard cards are misaligned and visually cramped on mobile

Spacing, sizing, and stacking need to be cleaned up so cards read clearly in a vertical flow

The calendar widget on the dashboard looks broken and poorly sized on mobile and needs to be simplified or resized so it fits naturally in the layout

Navigation behaviour on mobile

All hover-based or reactive hover effects must be disabled on mobile

Sidebar expansion, hover animations, and hover-dependent attributes should not run on mobile at all

Mobile navigation must rely only on tap-based interactions

Mobile nav button (critical)

The mobile navbar / menu button is sometimes unclickable

It becomes especially inaccessible after scrolling on certain pages

This must be fixed so the button is always tappable, visible, and responsive regardless of scroll position or page

Ensure no overlays, z-index issues, or layout elements block it

Side navbar scrolling

On mobile, the side navbar content overflows the screen

Logout and Settings are positioned off-screen and require awkward scrolling

The side navbar must be vertically scrollable on mobile so all options are accessible

Navigation content should never be cut off

Graphs on dashboard

Graphs are not optimised for mobile screen width

They overflow, feel cramped, or are hard to read

Adjust sizing, margins, or layout so graphs are readable and contained on mobile

Gamification / rewards settings

Some elements (buttons, controls, inputs) extend off-screen on mobile

All interactive elements must stay within the viewport width

Ensure buttons are tappable and not clipped

Final intent

The goal is not to redesign the mobile UI, but to:

Remove broken interactions

Ensure everything fits on screen

Make all core actions usable from a phone

Prevent hover logic, overlays, or layout bugs from blocking interaction

Focus on stability, accessibility, and basic usability on mobile while preserving the existing desktop experience exactly as it is.
