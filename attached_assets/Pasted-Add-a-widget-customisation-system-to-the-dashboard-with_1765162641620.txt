Add a widget customisation system to the dashboard without modifying the appearance, size, spacing, behaviour, or layout of any existing widgets.

Everything must look exactly the same as it currently does.  
Do not change widget CSS, HTML structure, grid layout, row widths, heights, card sizes, or placement.  
The current widget order must remain unchanged and act as the default layout.

====================================
1. REMOVE UNUSED ANALYTICS BUTTON
====================================

Remove the “Dashboard Settings” button from the Analytics page.  
Do not change the design or spacing of the Analytics page otherwise.

====================================
2. CUSTOMISE WIDGETS BUTTON (VISUAL IMPROVEMENT ONLY)
====================================

Improve the look of the “Customise Widgets” button on the dashboard without affecting the dashboard layout.

• Replace only the button’s styling  
• Do NOT change card spacing, row height, margins, or grid alignment  
• Button should remain in the same position

Suggested style:
bg-white/5 border border-white/10 px-4 py-2 rounded-full hover:bg-white/10 transition flex items-center gap-2

====================================
3. DATA MODEL (NO IMPACT ON LAYOUT)
====================================

In user_settings, add two fields:

dashboard_order: a list storing widget IDs  
dashboard_active: a map of widget IDs → True/False  

On first load, automatically populate dashboard_order with the **current widget order exactly as it exists right now**, in the exact sequence they currently appear.

Do NOT change the rendered order unless the user manually edits it through the new settings UI.

dashboard_active should default to True for every current widget.

====================================
4. DO NOT MODIFY ANY WIDGET CODE
====================================

All existing widgets:
• must render exactly the same way  
• must stay in the same positions by default  
• must keep their current height  
• must keep their current width  
• must keep all the spacing they have now  

No new wrapper divs, no new grid classes, no layout restructuring.

====================================
5. CUSTOMISE WIDGETS PANEL
====================================

Create a modal or settings panel opened by the “Customise Widgets” button.

Inside the panel:

SECTION A — Toggle Visibility  
• Show a toggle switch for each widget  
• Toggling on/off updates dashboard_active  
• This only hides/shows the widget, NOT resize or move anything else  

SECTION B — Reorder Widgets  
• Show all widgets in their current default order initially  
• Provide ↑ and ↓ buttons to move a widget one position up or down in dashboard_order  
• Do NOT animate or preview layout changes in the dashboard  
• Only the ORDER value changes — the layout stays as-is until the user refreshes the dashboard page

====================================
6. DASHBOARD RENDERING LOGIC
====================================

When rendering the dashboard:

1. Load dashboard_order  
2. Load dashboard_active  
3. Render widgets in the order specified by dashboard_order  
4. Skip widgets where dashboard_active[id] = False  
5. Do NOT modify any HTML/CSS of the grid or widgets  

If dashboard_order is missing or corrupted:
• automatically regenerate using the **current layout as the default**.

====================================
7. STRICT VISUAL PROTECTION
====================================

Under no circumstances should this feature:
• resize widgets  
• reposition widgets automatically  
• stack widgets differently  
• alter the grid  
• remove or add padding/margins  
• change card dimensions  
• cause wrapping or collapsing  

The dashboard must look **identical** to the current version unless the user intentionally changes widget order or visibility.
