Implement the following features. Gamification elements should live primarily on a dedicated page, with only minimal summary numbers shown on the dashboard.

====================================
1. GAMIFICATION SYSTEM
====================================

Add tables:

user_stats (single row):
- current_xp
- current_level
- current_outreach_streak_days
- longest_outreach_streak_days
- last_outreach_date
- last_consistency_score
- last_consistency_calculated_at

achievements:
- key
- name
- description
- unlocked_at (nullable)

XP RULES:
Give XP when:
- outreach_log created (+5)
- lead status → contacted (+3)
- lead status → call_booked (+7)
- lead status → proposal_sent (+10)
- lead status → closed_won (+20)
- task marked done (+8)

Add helper functions:
- add_xp(amount)
- update_outreach_streak()
- calculate_consistency_score()
- check_and_unlock_achievements()

OUTREACH STREAK:
- If outreach today and last_outreach_date is yesterday → streak += 1
- If last_outreach_date is today → do nothing
- If older than yesterday → reset streak to 1
- longest streak updates automatically

ACHIEVEMENTS:
Seed defaults:
- Streak 7 days
- Streak 30 days
- XP 1000
- XP 5000
- 100 outreach logs
- 10 deals closed

Unlock when criteria met.

CONSISTENCY SCORE (0–100):
Based on previous 7 days:
- outreach vs daily goal * 7
- follow-ups performed
- tasks completed
Average percentages → score saved in user_stats.

====================================
2. GAMIFICATION PAGE
====================================

Create a new Blueprint: "gamification" with route prefix "/gamification".

Main page: GET /gamification  
Show full detail of all gamification elements:

SECTIONS TO DISPLAY:

1) XP & Level
- Current XP
- XP gained this week (small chart)
- Level (if levels are used)

2) Outreach Streak
- Current streak
- Longest streak
- Streak history chart (line graph of streak length by day)

3) Achievements
- Grid/list of unlocked achievements with dates
- Locked achievements displayed faded/greyed out

4) Consistency Score
- Current score (big number)
- Score history (last 30 days line chart)
- Breakdown of consistency components:
  - outreach consistency %
  - follow-up consistency %
  - task completion consistency %

Charts should use Chart.js.

====================================
3. DASHBOARD INTEGRATION (MINIMAL)
====================================

Dashboard should display ONLY:
- XP (small card)
- Current streak (small card)
- Consistency Score (small card)

Each card links to /gamification for full details.

No achievements, no charts, no streak history on the dashboard.  
Keep it clean.

====================================
4. GOALS SYSTEM
====================================

Add table: goals  
Fields:
- goal_type (daily_outreach, weekly_outreach, monthly_revenue, monthly_deals)
- period (“daily”, “weekly”, “monthly”)
- target_value
- is_manual (boolean)
- timestamps

AUTO-GENERATED GOALS (default when no manual goal exists):
- daily_outreach = avg last 30 days → rounded up
- weekly_outreach = avg last 8 weeks → rounded up
- monthly_revenue = avg last 3 months → rounded up
- monthly_deals = avg last 3 months → rounded up

GOALS PAGE (/goals):
- Show recommended value
- Show current active goal
- Provide input field for manual override
- Checkbox: “Keep manual goal”
- Button: “Reset to recommended”

If manual goal is deleted or reset → revert to recommended.

====================================
5. UI HOOKS
====================================

Add navbar link: “Gamification”.

On /gamification:
- Show XP, streak, achievements, consistency metrics, charts.

On /dashboard:
- ONLY show:
  - XP
  - Streak
  - Consistency score
- Link all three to the Gamification page.

Ensure goals integrate with:
- streak scoring  
- consistency scoring  
- XP updates
