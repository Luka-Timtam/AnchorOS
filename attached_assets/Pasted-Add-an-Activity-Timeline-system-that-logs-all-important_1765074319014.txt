Add an Activity Timeline system that logs all important user actions into a unified feed and displays them chronologically.

====================================
1. DATA MODEL
====================================

Create table: activity_log
Fields:
- id (pk)
- timestamp (datetime)
- action_type (string)
- description (text)
- related_id (integer, nullable)      # lead_id, task_id, mission_id etc.
- related_object_type (string)        # "lead", "task", "mission", "boss", etc.

====================================
2. LOGGING HELPER FUNCTION
====================================

Create helper function log_activity(action_type, description, related_id=None, related_object_type=None).

This function inserts a new row into activity_log with current timestamp.

====================================
3. EVENTS TO LOG
====================================

Log entries for:
- outreach logged → “Logged outreach for Lead X”
- lead contacted → “Contacted Lead X”
- call booked → “Booked call with Lead X”
- proposal sent → “Sent proposal to Lead X”
- deal closed_won → “Closed X (WON)”
- deal closed_lost → “Closed X (LOST) — Reason: <reason>”
- task created → “Created task: <title>”
- task completed → “Completed task: <title>”
- task overdue → “Task overdue: <title>”
- daily mission completed → “Completed mission: <description>”
- boss progress update → “Boss progress updated: <current>/<target>”
- boss defeated → “Boss defeated: <description>”
- tokens earned → “Earned X tokens”
- XP gained → “Gained X XP”
- streak increased → “Streak increased to X days”
- pause mode activated → “Pause Mode activated until <date>”
- pause mode ended → “Pause Mode ended”

Use a short readable description for each.

====================================
4. TIMELINE PAGE
====================================

Add route /timeline.

This page shows a descending chronological feed:

• Timestamp  
• Icon based on action_type  
• Description text  
• Optional link to related item:
    - If related_object_type = "lead" → link to lead page
    - If "task" → link to task page

Pagination required:
- Show 50 items per page
- Next / Previous buttons

====================================
5. DASHBOARD PREVIEW
====================================

On dashboard, add a small “Recent Activity” widget showing the last 5 actions with a link:
“View full timeline → /timeline”

====================================
6. OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS
====================================

Group actions by day:
- “Today”
- “Yesterday”
- “Earlier this week”
- “Last week”
- “Older”

Highlight special events:
- boss defeated
- level ups
- large XP gains
- completed deals
